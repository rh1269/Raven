//List bots	
//List spawn points
//process team goal (make new goals for teams)
//Handle messages
 * Other stuff- kill entity manager
 * make "loose bots"? Ask
 * add to iraven interface (?) In Progress
 *
 * TODO 
 * Teams are based on a captain
 * protect captain
 * Find Captain
 * Scatter(Leader is dead)
 * Kill enemy leader
 * Murder defenders
 * We need a brain/goal to "Stay close to captain"
 * We need a message handler to deal with "Score increased"
 * 
 * Just different flavors of pursuit, or evade.
 * Also there needs to be a way to tell the leader to move more slowly
 * have more hit points, etc.
